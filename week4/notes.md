# Month 1, Week 4: The Unabridged Learning Guide

### JavaScript - The Language Core (Part 2)

#### Introduction: From Logic to Structure

Welcome, architects. In Week 3, we forged the foundational tools of logic: variables to store information and conditionals to make decisions. We learned how to create a single path of execution. This week, we elevate our craft. We will learn to create systemsâ€”to manage repetition, to build reusable components, and to structure complex data. This is the week we move from writing simple scripts to architecting the foundations of real applications.

#### Module 0: Revisiting the Foundation - A Deeper Look at Conditionals

A deep understanding of how a program makes decisions is non-negotiable. Let's solidify this foundation.

#### The Nuance of Truthy & Falsy

We learned the six falsy values: `false`, `0`, `""`, `null`, `undefined`, and `NaN`. Everything else is truthy. But why does this exist? It allows for more expressive and concise code that often reads closer to plain English.

|Verbose Check|Pragmatic (Truthy/Falsy) Check|Reads As...|
|---|---|---|
|`if (itemsInCart !== 0)`|`if (itemsInCart)`|"If we have items in the cart..."|
|`if (username !== '')`|`if (username)`|"If a username exists..."|
|`if (error !== null)`|`if (error)`|"If there is an error..."|

This pattern is a hallmark of professional JavaScript code. Master it.

#### The `switch` Statement: A Closer Look

The `switch` statement is a specialized conditional for comparing one value against a list of variants.

#### The Crucial Role of `break` and "Fall-Through"

The `break` keyword is essential. When a `case` is matched, the code executes until it hits a `break` statement, at which point it exits the `switch` block entirely. If you omit the `break`, something interesting called "fall-through" happens: the code will continue executing the code in the next `case` block, regardless of whether its value matches.

```JavaScript
const userRole = 'editor';

switch (userRole) {
  case 'admin':
    console.log('Full access granted.');
    // No break!
  case 'editor':
    console.log('Content writing access granted.'); // This will run
    break; // Exits here
  case 'viewer':
    console.log('View-only access granted.');
    break;
}
// Output: "Content writing access granted."
```

While sometimes used intentionally, accidental fall-through is a common source of bugs. **Always include a `break` unless you have a specific reason for fall-through.**

#### Module 1: Automating Repetition - Loops

Loops are the solution to the universal programming problem: "How do I do something over and over again?"

#### The `for` Loop: A Step-by-Step Execution Trace

Let's dissect this loop with surgical precision:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
```

1. Initialization (`let i = 0`): This happens one time only, before anything else. A variable `i` is created and set to `0`. `i` is now `0`.
2. Condition Check (`i < 3`): Is `0 < 3`? Yes, it's `true`. So, the loop body will execute.
3. Loop Body Executes: `console.log(i)` prints `0`.
4. Final Expression (`i++`): The value of `i` is incremented. `i` is now `1`.
5. Condition Check (`i < 3`): Is `1 < 3`? Yes, it's `true`. The body will execute again.
6. Loop Body Executes: `console.log(i)` prints `1`.
7. Final Expression (`i++`): The value of `i` is incremented. `i` is now `2`.
8. Condition Check (`i < 3`): Is `2 < 3`? Yes, it's `true`. The body will execute again.
9. Loop Body Executes: `console.log(i)` prints `2`.
10. Final Expression (`i++`): The value of `i` is incremented. `i` is now `3`.
11. Condition Check (`i < 3`): Is `3 < 3`? No, it's `false`. The loop terminates.

#### The `while` loop: Ask Now, Act Later 

A `while` loop in JavaScript is a control flow statement that repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition evaluates to `true`.

The loop checks the condition before executing the code block. If the condition is `true`, the code runs. This cycle continues until the condition becomes `false`, at which point the loop stops.

##### Syntax

The basic syntax for a `while` loop is:

```JavaScript

while (condition) {
  // code to be executed as long as the condition is true
}
```

* `condition`: An expression that is evaluated before each pass through the loop. If it evaluates to `true`, the code block is executed. If it evaluates to `false`, the loop terminates.

##### How It Works

1. The `condition` is checked.
2. If the condition is `true`:
  * The code inside the `{}` block is executed.
  * The process goes back to step 1.
3. If the condition is `false`:
  * The loop is skipped, and the program continues with the code that follows the loop.

##### Code Examples

###### Example 1: A Simple Counter

This is a classic example that counts from 1 to 5 and prints each number to the console.

```JavaScript

let count = 1; // 1. Initialize the counter

while (count <= 5) { // 2. Set the condition
  console.log("The count is: " + count);
  count++; // 3. IMPORTANT: Increment the counter
}

console.log("Loop finished!");
```

###### Explanation:

1. We start with a variable `count` set to `1`.
2. The `while` loop checks if `count <= 5`. Since `1` is less than or equal to `5`, the condition is `true`, and the loop body executes.
3. Inside the loop, it prints the current value of `count` and then increments it by one (`count++`).
4. The loop checks the condition again. Now `count` is `2`. `2 <= 5` is still `true`, so the loop runs again.
5. This process continues until `count` becomes `6`. At that point, the condition `6 <= 5` is `false`, the loop terminates, and "`Loop finished!`" is printed.

###### Warning: Infinite Loops

If you forget to include a way for the condition to become `false` (like `count++` in the example above), you will create an infinite loop, which will crash your program or browser tab.

```JavaScript

// DANGER: This is an infinite loop!
let i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
  console.log("This will run forever!");
  // 'i' is never incremented, so 'i < 10' is always true.
}
```

###### Example 2: Processing an Array

A `while` loop is useful when you want to modify an array until it's empty, as the number of iterations depends on the array's changing size.

```JavaScript

let tasks = ["Wash dishes", "Do laundry", "Walk the dog"];

while (tasks.length > 0) {
  let currentTask = tasks.shift(); // .shift() removes and returns the first item
  console.log("Processing task: " + currentTask);
}

console.log("All tasks completed!");
console.log("Tasks left: " + tasks.length); // Outputs: Tasks left: 0
```

###### Explanation:

1. The loop continues as long as `tasks.length > 0` (the array is not empty).
2. Inside the loop, `tasks.shift()` removes the first element from the array.
3. This removed element is processed (in this case, printed to the console).
4. Each iteration shortens the array, so eventually `tasks.length` becomes `0`, the condition is `false`, and the loop stops.

#### The `do...while` Loop: Act First, Ask Later

A lesser-known cousin of the `while` loop is the `do...while` loop. Its unique feature is that the loop body is **guaranteed to execute at least once**, because the condition is checked after the first iteration.

```javascript
let userResponse;
do {
  userResponse = prompt("Please enter 'yes' to continue:"); // This will always run at least once.
} while (userResponse !== 'yes');

console.log("You entered 'yes'!");
```

This is useful for scenarios like prompting a user for input until it's valid.

#### Module 2: The Art of Reusability - Functions
Functions allow us to package logic into reusable, named blocks. They are the single most important tool for organizing complex programs.

##### Function Declarations vs. Function Expressions

There are two primary ways to create a function. The difference is subtle but important.

* **Function Declaration:**
```javascript
// Hoisted: Can be called before it's defined in the code.
console.log(add(5, 10)); // 15

function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```
Declarations are "hoisted" to the top of their scope by the JavaScript interpreter, meaning you can call them before they appear in your code.

* Function Expression: (Assigning an anonymous function to a variable)
```javascript
// Not Hoisted: Must be defined before it is called.
// console.log(subtract(10, 5)); // This would cause a ReferenceError!

const subtract = function(a, b) {
  return a - b;
};
```
Modern best practice, especially with `const`, is to use function expressions (or arrow functions) to prevent issues related to hoisting and to enforce a more linear, top-to-bottom code readability.

##### The Concept of Pure Functions

A "pure function" is a function that, given the same input, **will always return the same output** and has **no side effects**. A side effect is any interaction with the outside world from within the function (e.g., changing a global variable, writing to the console, making a network request).

* Pure Function:
```javascript
const calculatePrice = (base, taxRate) => base * (1 + taxRate);
```
* Impure Function (has a side effect):
```javascript
let totalSales = 0;
function addToTotal(amount) {
  totalSales += amount; // Side effect: modifies a variable outside itself.
  return totalSales;
}
```

Striving to write pure functions makes your code more predictable, easier to test, and less prone to bugs.

#### Module 3: Architecting Data - Complex Structures

##### Arrays: A Deeper Look

An array is more than just a list; it's a powerful object with built-in properties and methods.

* `length` **Property:** Not a method! It's a property that tells you how many elements are in the array.
```javascript
const team = ['Alex', 'Jane', 'Peter'];
console.log(team.length); // 3
```
* **Essential Methods (Actions that modify the array):**
  * `push(item)`: Adds an item to the **end**.
  * `pop()`: Removes (and returns) the item from the **end**.
  * `unshift(item)`: Adds an item to the **beginning**.
  * `shift()`: Removes (and returns) the item from the **beginning**.

##### Objects: The Building Blocks of Models

Objects allow us to model real-world things by grouping related data.

###### Adding, Modifying, and Deleting Properties:

Once an object is created, it is mutable. You can change its contents.

```javascript
const car = {
  make: 'Honda',
  model: 'Civic'
};

// 1. Adding a new property
car.year = 2022;
car['color'] = 'blue';

// 2. Modifying an existing property
car.model = 'Accord';

// 3. Deleting a property
delete car.make;

console.log(car); // { model: 'Accord', year: 2022, color: 'blue' }
```

###### Using Variables as Keys (Bracket Notation's Superpower):

Bracket notation allows you to use the value of a variable to access a property. This is impossible with dot notation and is essential for dynamic programming.

```javascript
const propertyToAccess = 'model';
const myCar = { make: 'Toyota', model: 'Camry' };

console.log(myCar[propertyToAccess]); // 'Camry'
// console.log(myCar.propertyToAccess); // undefined, because it looks for a key named "propertyToAccess"
```

#### Take-Home Assignment: The To-Do List Manager

**Objective:** To build a complete mini-application using arrays, objects, functions, and loops. This is a significant step towards building real applications.

1. **Setup:** Create a file `todo.js`.
2. **The Data Structure:** Your to-do list will be stored in an array of objects. Each object will represent a single task.
```javascript
const todoList = [
    { id: 1, task: 'Buy groceries', completed: false },
    { id: 2, task: 'Finish Week 4 assignment', completed: true }
];
let nextId = 3;
```
3. **The Functions:**
  * `displayTasks()`: A function that takes no arguments. It should loop through the `todoList` array and print each task to the console, indicating whether it's complete or not (e.g., `"[x] Buy groceries"` or `"[ ] Clean room"`).
  * `addTask(taskText)`: A function that takes a string as an argument. It should create a new task object (with a unique `id`, the provided `taskText`, and `completed: false`), add it to the `todoList` array, and increment the `nextId` counter.
  * `markTaskComplete(taskId)`: A function that takes a number (an `id`) as an argument. It should find the task object in the array with the matching `id` and change its `completed` status to `true`.
4. **The Simulation:** At the bottom of your file, write code to simulate using your application:
```javascript
console.log("--- Initial To-Do List ---");
displayTasks();

console.log("\n--- Adding New Tasks ---");
addTask("Clean the kitchen");
addTask("Read a chapter of a book");
displayTasks();

console.log("\n--- Completing a Task ---");
markTaskComplete(1); // Mark 'Buy groceries' as complete
displayTasks();
```
5. **Bonus Challenge:** Create a function `deleteTask(taskId)` that removes a task object from the array based on its `id`. This is more complex and will require you to research array methods like `findIndex()` and `splice()`.
6. **Submission:** Submit your `todo.js file via a Pull Request to your personal assignments repository, following the professional branching workflow we learned in Week 2.
